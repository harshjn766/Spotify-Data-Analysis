# Spotify-Data-Analysis

I utilized Python's data manipulation libraries like Pandas to explore and preprocess the data, ensuring its cleanliness and readiness for analysis. 
Performed data cleaning and data pre-processing on dirty dataset with the use of Python(Pandas), Excel.

I employed Matplotlib, a versatile data visualization library, to create a wide range of charts and graphs. This included bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and pie charts, among others, to effectively communicate patterns and trends in the music data.

I conducted EDA by visually exploring the relationships between factors like song duration, popularity, and danceability, helping me uncover hidden patterns and insights.
